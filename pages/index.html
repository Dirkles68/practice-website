    <h4>Hey everyone! This is my project website!</h4>
    <p>I hope this turns out well. I know it does not look like much, but give it some time. It will look like a geocities page in no time!</p>
    <h2>What will be on this page?</h2>
    <p>Anything I learn of course! To start off with I think I will include some links. How about these:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#">Boom</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Boom 2: Electric Boomgaloo</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Boom 3</a></li>
    </ul>
